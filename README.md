# FinalProject

Final Project repo for CS65-F18


You can find the writeup for the project here:

[https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~richardw/classes/cs65/f18/finalproj.html](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~richardw/classes/cs65/f18/finalproj.html)

NOTE: this is not the most up-to-date version of the repo, since I don't have access to the full repo anymore. However, the writeup is the final paper for the project. The rest of the repo outside of this readme has been untouched.

## Components

- NLP_Final_Project.pdf - Final paper for the project
- `hyper_partisan_main.py` - script used for running tuning the hyperparameters of the different models. Note: we only have the one function `do_experiment` since we were manually plugging in the different models and parameters.
- `HyperPartisanNewsReader.py` - library for parsing the input and extracting the labels and features.
- `semeval-pan-2019-evaluator.py` - test set used to evaluate the performance of the trained models
- `/images/` - confusion matrices for the three trained models
- `/outputs/` - raw outputs of the various models
